# Zerops x Laravel Jetstream

![Zerops x Laravel](https://github.com/fxck/zerops-laravel-hello-world/assets/1303561/d9289e32-09bc-414b-87a4-423cb8283e9b)

[Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/introduction.html) is an advanced starter kit by Laravel. Zerops recipe for Jetstream includes all the advanced functionality â€” session and cache stored in Redis and files stored in Object Storage, this makes it perfectly suitable for production of any size.

## Deploy on Zerops
You can either click the deploy button to deploy on Zerops directly, or manually copy the [import yaml](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-jetstream/blob/main/zerops-project-import.yml) to the import dialog in Zerops app.

- Zerops **Object Storage** (S3 compatible) service as file system
- Proper setup for Laravel **cache**, **optimization**, and **database migrations**
- Logs set up to use **syslog** and accessible through Zerops GUI
- Utilization of Zerops built-in **environment variables** system
- [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) as **SMTP mock server**
- [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org) for **quick database management** tool

## Production vs. development

Base of the recipe is ready for production, the difference comes down to:

- Use highly available version of the PostgreSQL database (change *mode* from *NON_HA* to *HA* in recipe YAML *db* service)
- Use at least two containers for Jetstream service to achieve high reliability and resilience (add *minContainers: 2* in recipe YAML *app* service)
- Use production-ready third-party SMTP server instead of Mailpit (change *MAIL_* secret variables in recipe YAML *app* service)
- Disable public access to Adminer or remove it altogether (remove service adminer from recipe YAML)

## Changes made over the default installation

If you want to modify your own app running Jetstream to efficiently run on Zerops, these are the steps we took:

- Add [zerops.yml](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-jetstream/blob/main/zerops.yml) to your repository, our example includes idempotent migrations, caching, and optimized build process
- Add [league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-jetstream/blob/main/composer.json#L14) to your composer.json to support Object Storage file system
- Setup [Jetstream config](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-jetstream/blob/main/config/jetstream.php#L79) to use object storage for file system
- Utilize Zerops [environment variables](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-laravel-jetstream/blob/main/README.md) to utilize S3 for file system, Redis for cache and sessions, and trusted proxies to work with reverse proxy load balancer
